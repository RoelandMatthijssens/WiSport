\section{Introduction}
This document will describe the implementation and usage of WiSport. WiSport is website created within the scope of the course Web and Information Systems at the Vrije 
Universiteit Brussel. The goal of the website is to offer users a guide with with their personal training, aswell as making users able to do some training exercises 
together with some friends.


WiSport offers users the possibility to create exercises. These exercises can be exercises over time, distance or a number of repetitions. These exercises can be
shared with the WiSport community. Next to exercises users can also create training sessions. Training session contain a number of exercises that have to be completed
within this one session. Just as with the exercises these sessions can be shared with the WiSport community.


Shared exercises or sessions can be found by all WiSport users. These users can star these exercises or sessions. Each starred exercise or session gets added to the 
exercises or sessions of the user himselve. This means that from now one users can create new sessions containing some starred exercises.


Next to exercises and training sessions users can also create events. Events are moments on wich a training session will take place. Users can add to each event a place
where it will take place. After creating an event this event gets added to the personal calendar of the user.

When a session is done multiple times we can track our progress in doing this session, or on each individual exercise of the training session. The progression made is 
showed in clear graphs

In short is WiSport the ideal help for anyone willing to organize their training and share these trainings with other users.

\section{Ruby On Rails}
\input{./RoR.tex}
\section{Used API's}
\subsection{Gravatar}
It is always nice to have an avatar to users. The web service Gravatar gives users a central location to setup avatars. We use the Gravatar API to automatically take the user's gravatar and display it on his profile page.
\subsection{Authentication}
Users often don't like to create yet an other account, with a username and password which they will not remember. This is why we decide to allow users to login using different web services. The Omniauth gem \footnote{Visit https://github.com/intridea/omniauth for more information} makes it easy to add authentication from some of the major services on the web. Our most used log in method is Google. It will take your Google plus profile picture and use it on the website, in stead of the Gravatar avatar.
\subsection{Weather}
In class we used wunderground in the exercises. Their easy API made us chose them above weather.com.
\subsection{Maps}
Google maps is integrated using the google maps for rails gem\footnote{Visit https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails for more information}. This gem provides us hooks between the rails controller and the Google maps Javascript API. We use html5 geolocation for location based queries, as well as IP based location. You can read more about IP based location in the next section
\subsection{IP based location}
In a many cases it is not necessary to annoy the user with permission requests, that is why we decided to also use IP based location. InfoDB\footnote{http://ipinfodb.com/} provides you with an easy API to translate IP addresses into geographical coordinates.
\subsection{Media hosting}
Users can add pictures and movies to exercises. In stead of storing the pictures on our own servers, we use the Imgur api\footnote{Visit http://api.imgur.com/ for more information} to upload the pictures to Imgur. Currently we only accept youtube clips. These will be displayed using the static youtube API.
\subsection{Graphs}


\section{Features}
\subsection{Login through social media}
Next to the tradtional possibility to sign up and login with an account made on our
website there's the possibility to log in with multiple versions of social media. We
have provided a log in with Google, Facebook and Twitter. When logging in with you

Google account the picture of you Google profile is copied on to your WiSport profile.

\subsection{Editting sessions/exercises/events}
After you have created an exercise, session or event you have to possibility to change
this event. In the case of an exercise you can edit your properties of this exercise.
A clear example of this could be if you have a distance exercise, in wich you run 5
kilometers. Chances are big that after half a year you don't even bother about running
5 kilometers, but would like to start running 10 kilometers in stead. If this is the case
you don't need to create a new exercise, being a running exercise of 10 kilometers, and
possible delete the old exercise of 5 kilometers. You can just edit the existing exercise
to a 10 km running exercise. As the graphs of your progress do not rely on this value,
but rely on the value you enter when doing an exercise this will not effect your progress
on this exercise. Within your progress graph you'll see the actual distances you ran.
\subsection{Publish exercises and sessions}
When a user creates an exercise or session and they are pleased with it they can share it whith the WiSport community. This is done by
pressing the Publish button on showed on each page of an exercise or session, showed within the list of own exercises, or even when 
creating an exercise or session you can immediatly choose to publish this exercise or session.

The published exercises can be starred by other users. As explained in the starred feature when starred a user can use an exercise
or session to create own sessions or events.
\subsection{Smart searchfields for exercises and sessions}
Within the list of all exercises and session some search form are implemented. You can search by name of the exercise/session or by
the creator. Next to this we also implemented a select box for the exercises. With this select box you can choose the type of exercises
that are getting displayed. This can help you whenever you are looking for a particular exercise to add to you own exercises. All these
searchforms can be combined together so that you can narrow your search down a long way.

The search forms are smart forms, this means you don't need to press search anywhere, but they dynamiclly change the list filtering out 
any results not matching the searchfield.

\subsection{Star sessions/exercises}
Every user has the possibility to publish their exercises or sessions. When published
these will apprear in the list of all exercises or sessions and other users will be able to
see these. When a user is browsing true this list they can star exercises or session which
look particular intresting to them. They can star these exercises or sessions and when
starred these will apear in personal excercises or sessions of the user.

This means that starred exercises can be used to create sessions and starred session can
be used to organise an event containing this session.


\subsection{Do a session}
Next to the possibilty to create a session an create an event around this session you
actually need to do a session. This means that even though you planned an event
today, you still have to say on the website you effectively done it. This is because
there's always a possibility somthing comes up, so you didn't do the event, but even
more, when doing a session you can enter some extra information. This can be some
additional notes, but, more importantly you can insert the actual value's you did for each
exercise. This means that if your exercise told you to run 10 kilometers, but you only
ran 8 you can enter this in the systems and this will take this into account when creating
your progression graph.
\subsection{Graphs tracking progress}
After you have completed a session and entered the actual numbers you performed to
each exercise graphs will be generated for earch exercise within this session. This gives
you the possibility to track your progression on a session, and even more you can check
the number times you completed an exercise, or the entire session.

Next to making graphs on the completion of exercises, you also get graphs on your
entire usage of the platform. For example on the login page you get a pie-graph which
shows you what percentage of what kind of exercises you made. This can be helpfull for
you to decide what kinds of exercise you can need more training in.

\subsection{Calendar view for events}
For events we make use of a clear calendar view. On this view you can see your planned
events, and from this view you can go to the actual page of this event, or delete or edit
this event. This gives you a clear view on your workload and makes it easier to plan
your sessions

\subsection{Weather}
On the events page before creating an event you can check the weather for your current
location. This gives you the possibility to plan your exercise session on a day the
weather is suitable. For example shedule your indoors exercises on a rainy day and plan
your outdoor activities on days it is less likely to rain.
\subsection{Share on Google+}
When you created a nice exercise or session on wich you are really proud you can
share this on you Google+ profile. Just as if you planned an event within the WiSport
platform you can choose to share this on your Google+ profile. This ensures you only
share this information with people you want it to be shared with. The idea behind this
is privacy, especially sharing on the internet when you are not going to be home isn't
always a good idea.
\subsection{Star sessions/exercises}
Every user has the possibility to publish their exercises or sessions. When published
these will apprear in the list of all exercises or sessions and other users will be able to
see these. When a user is browsing true this list they can star exercises or session which
look particular intresting to them. They can star these exercises or sessions and when
starred these will apear in personal excercises or sessions of the user.

This means that starred exercises can be used to create sessions and starred session can
be used to organise an event containing this session.

\subsection{Gravatar usage}
When people create an account or log in not using their Google account a picture is provided by Gravatar. This means people don't have 
to upload their profile picture to their WiSport account, but their pictures used by Gravatar is inserted in to their profile page.
\subsection{Scaleable interface}
Thanks to the use of Twitter Bootstrap the entire interface scales to the size of the screen it is displayed on. This means that when
the size of the screen is made smaller the entire website is scaled with it. Even when the size is to small to show the entire headerline
this line is reformed to a scrolldown box.

\subsection{Add location to an event by giving address}
Whenever an event is created the user can enter where this event will take place. This is done by just entering the address of the 
location. When the event is created on the event page a map will be shown on wich the location of the event is showed.
\subsection{Location my ip/ geoloc}
For the usage of the Weather API we make use of Location by ip. This means that you don't need to enter your location, but the location
of your current ip address is tracked.
\subsection{Find nearby events}
When going to the events page your can find all events planned on a map. This map is centralized around your curren location, so the 
closest events will be shown first. This gives you the ability to find all near events and if you please tag along on these.

By clicking on the markers more information is shown about this event. You can also go to the event page to get more information about
the event, and plan go along with this event.
\subsection{Database populator for testing purpose}
For testing purposes a database populator is created. This creator generates random dat, such as users, exercises, training sessions and
events. 

The use of this populator is to check the site's performances and acting with a higher number of users and data. This gives us the 
possibility to do some experiments with a lot of data. Especially for the creating the graphs this can be usefull.
\section{Tutorial}
\subsection{Logging in}
When entering the website for the first time you'll get some general information about the website. The first thing we advice you to do is create
an account, by pressing the Sign in button. Once you've made an account, or want to use one of your social media accounts you can log in by
pressing the Log In button and choose wether to enter the account information of an account created on our website, or log in trough Google,
Facebook or Twitter.

Once logged in you reach a new screen with some general information about your account. These are things like upcomming events, recently passed 
events and some statistics about the usage of your account.

\subsection{Exercise}
\subsubsection{My Exercises}
When clicking under the tab Exercises on My Exercises you'll see a list of all exercises you made and all exercises you starred. The 
exercises in this list can be used to later on make some training sessions.

For every exercise the you created you'll get some options as Destroy, Edit or Publish/Unpublish. The Destroy will delete this exercise
from the system, Edit wil give you ability to edit this exercise and Publish/Unpublish decides whether this exercise will show up
in the list of all exercises.
\subsubsection{All Exercises}
Under the tab All Exercises you'll see all exercises made by other users which are Published. You'll be able to take a look at the 
page of the exercise, to see what this exercise does by just clicking on it's name. You'll have to posibitly to check the creators page
by clicking on the name of the creator.

In front of the exercises in this list stands a little star which can be toggled on or off. When this star is toggled on, when the 
exercise is starred, this exercise will appear in the My Exercises list.

As you can see underneath the Title and Owner page there are some searchfields. Here you can enter some letters and instantly the 
list of exercises will be filtered, only containing those titles or users containing this sequence of letters. Under the Type you'll see
a foldbox in which you can enter the type of exercises you are looking for.

\subsubsection{Creating an exercise}
From within the My Exercises page you'll be able to press the New button to create a new exercise. Creating a new exercise will ask you
to give a name to the exercise, a type, decide if you will publish it or keep it private (which can be editted later on), it will also 
give you the chance to give a small description with this exercise.

At the bottem you'll be able to add a link to a youtube video, what can for example give a demo of the exercise, or add one or more
pictures bu or dragging them into the drag box, or by selecting them using the Select File button. 

To create the exercise you simply press Create Exercise on the bottem, or press Cancel if you changed your mind.

When pressing the Edit button of an exercise you'll get a similar form again, with the old information filled in. This will give you the
possiblity the edit this information.

\subsubsection{The exercise page}
Each exercise has a page of it's own. On this page you can see more information about the exercise, such as the added picturer, or 
added youtube video's, the value's entered for each sort of exercise (for example 10 km) and you can read the entire description 
of the exercise.

As owner of an exercise you'll be provided by some extra button, where you can choose to Edit, Publish/Unpublish the exercise or Destroy
the exercise. When looking at an exercise that is not made by you you'll see who created this exercise.

\subsection{Training sessions}
\subsubsection{My Training sessions}
In the My Training sessions page every session made by you, or starred by you will be listed. This list can be seen as the All
Exercises page. It contains search fields as the exercises, but here you can search on the title, the creator and the desciption of a session.
Also searching by exercises contained by a session can be done.

As an extra button here you can Do a training session. What this does you can check in the Do a trainings session section.
When pressing on the descirption of the training session you can see what exercises this training session contains.
\subsubsection{All Training sessions}
The All trainings Sessions can be seen as the All Exercises page. The differences are offcourse the search fields, here you can search,
similar to the My Trainings Session on owner, name and descirption. Similar as with the My Training Session page you can click on the 
discription to show the exercises it contains. 

\subsubsection{Create Training session}
By pressing the New button on the My Training Session page you'll be able to create a new trainings session. To create a new training
session you'll need to choose a number of exercises. You will be able to choose between all exercises listed in your My Exercise page.
You'll also be able to add a little description about the session and, as with the exercises you'll be able to publish these instantly.
\subsubsection{The Training session}
When clicking on the name of a training session you'll be redirected to this page. This page contains all information about a training
session such as the exercises that need to be done within this session and a description of this session. At the bottem of this page
you'll see some graphs containing your progress on each exercise of this session. With this you'll be able to track you progress on this
exercise.
\subsubsection{Do a Training session} 
When you're at the My Training Sessions page, the All Trainings session page or at the page of a trainings session you'll see a Do button
This buttons allows you to tell the system you've done the session and submit your results. You can give it a small note, you can enter
the real value's you've realized (when you for example only ran 8km on a 10km exercerise) and enter the time you needed to complete an 
exercise. This data will be used to create the graphs showing your progress.

\subsection{Events} 
When you click on the Events link you'll find your personal calendar within Wisport. On this calendar you can see you planned events
