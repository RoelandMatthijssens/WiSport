Ruby on rails is an opensource full-stack webframework. This means that Ruby on Rails, or Rails in short is used to tackle every aspect of webdevelopment. Rails runs on the general purpose programming language Ruby.
The main benefit of using the Rails framework is the speed at which one can get a running web application. Almost no setup is required, and once the setup is complete, the paradigm of Convention over Configuration ensures that most of the website is developped quickly.
Ruby on rails employs, like most webframeworks, a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. By default all models in the application are mapped directly to a database. This makes it easy to have persistance even when the programmer is using only the classes.

Another huge benefit of using Rails is the fact that is has an enormous comunity. This community creates exrta plug and play functionality for a rails application by means of rubygems. Rubygems (or gems in short) are self contained libraries that can be installed into a rails application.
